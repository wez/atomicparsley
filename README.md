## A note on maintenance!

> I made some fixes to the original project on sourceforge back in 2009 and
> became the de-facto fork of AtomicParsley as a result.  However, I haven't
> used this tool myself in many years and have acted in a very loose guiding
> role since then.
>
> In 2020 Bitbucket decided to cease hosting Mercurial based repositories
> which meant that I had to move it in order to keep it alive, so you'll
> see a flurry of recent activity.
>
> I'll consider merging pull requests if they are easy to review, but because
> I don't use this tool myself I have no way to verify complex changes.
> If you'd like to make such a change, please consider contributing some
> kind of basic automated test with a corresponding small test file.
>
> This repo has GitHub Actions enabled for the three major platforms
> so bootstrapping some test coverage is feasible.
>
> You are welcome to report issues using the issue tracker, but I (@wez)
> am unlikely to act upon them.
