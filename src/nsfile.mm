APar_TestTracksForKind

    By testing which tracks are contained within the file, for Mac OS X we can avoid having to change file extension by instead using Finder.app metadata to signal
		the same info as file extension. For each trak atom, find the 'stsd' atom - its ancillary_data will contain the track type that is contained - the info is filled
		in as the file was initially parsed in APar_ScanAtoms. Then using Mac OS X Cocoa calls (in AP_NSFile_utils), set the Finder TYPE/CREATOR codes to signal to the
		OS/Finder/iTunes that this file is .m4a or .m4v without having to change its extension based on what the tracks actually contain.
		
		There are 2 issues with this - iTunes requires the Quicktime player type/creator codes for video that has multi-channel audio, and for chapterized video files.
		TODO: address these issues.
